# ACME Demo Server
> This project acts as a backend Verifier for a fictional customer, Acme, which uses Unum ID for the [passwordless auth](https://www.unum.id/solutions/passwordless-auth) solution for authentication. The backend issuer that works on conjunction with this demo can be found the [Demo Issuer Server](https://github.com/UnumID/demo-issuer-server) repo.

Information about the Unum ID demo ecosystem can be found in our [documentation](https://docs.unum.id/#demos).

# feathers-mikro-orm-starter

A starter app using [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com) and [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io) with some additional configuration set up

## What the starter app includes
### Feathers
- REST and socket.io transports
- Local and JWT authentication (not really configured)

### MikroORM
- postgres driver
- cli
- custom (ish) migration scripts
- config file
- `BaseEntity` abstract class with `uuid`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` properties

### feathers-mikro-orm
- our custom adatper to help feathers and mikroORM play nice together

### Unum ID types
- our shared types library, so you won't have to redefine the interface for a PresentationRequest again. Info can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unumid/types).

### ESLint
- configured for TypeScript and [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)

### Jest
- not a whole lot of custom config here, hopefully it _jest_ works

### Logging
- [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) configured to log to papertrail via syslog

### Environment config
- dotenv
- example `.env` file with a few variables defined for database access, logging, etc
- `config.ts` file exporting all of our environment variables with correct types and default values

### How to Use
- clone this repository
- create a new repo in our github organzation and update the origin remote to it (so you don't accidentally push changes to this starter repo) 
- that's about it, really
